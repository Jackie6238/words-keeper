# About Words Keeper

Words Keeper is a personal project that I built at the end of my first coop term when I was working as an IT Support Assistant. It serves as a showcase for what I learned from Angela's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" during my free time.

Words Keeper is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of new words they encounter along with their definitions. It serves as a personal vocabulary manager, helping users expand their language skills.

## Features

- **Add Words**: Users can easily add new words they come across, along with the corresponding definitions, by using the "Add" feature. The new word will be saved to their collection.
- **Edit Words**: Words Keeper allows users to edit existing words in their collection. They can update the spelling or definition of a word whenever needed.
- **Delete Words**: If a word is no longer relevant or has been mastered, users can remove it from their collection using the "Delete" feature.

## Technical Details

Words Keeper is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store the words and their definitions in a structured format.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool used to create schemas and interact with the database.
- **EJS**: A templating engine for rendering dynamic content in the HTML files.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework that provides pre-styled components and layouts for responsive web design.

The website is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where the model represents the data (e.g., words and their definitions), the view handles the presentation (HTML/EJS templates), and the controller manages the logic and interactions between the model and view (Express.js routes).

Words Keeper is a full-stack web application that uses server-side rendering to generate dynamic HTML pages and allows users to interact with the website without needing to reload the page. With the user-friendly interface and essential vocabulary management features, Words Keeper aims to assist users in their language-learning journey.
